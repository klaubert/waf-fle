WAF-FLE ChangeLog


Version 0.6.4: 2014
-------------
Bug: Lack of output enconding in some filter fields (filter dialog and 
     current filter), when a bogus hostname present in event, cause 
     improper html rendering. Thanks to Marcus Semblano to report and 
     supply with samples.
Improve: mlog2waffle requirements better clarified em their README, and
         now is possible to use it with old version of libwww-perl, but 
         no self-signed certificate in that case;
Improve: Better error message in case of database error;
Improve: mlog2waffle now has a crontab script;
Improve: you can disable/enable error log in mlog2waffle in 
         mlog2waffle.conf;
Improve: waf-fle.conf minor text adjustment
Improve: Corrected push-mlogc.sh template in Event Feeder Wizard;
Improve: Filter for preserved events added. Thanks to Juraj Sakala;
Improve: Some grammar correction. Thanks to Cliton Nichols;
Improve: Now accept events sent by mod_security compiled/patched by 
         Atomic Turtle to change label "Producer" to "WAF". Issue #22 
         and #48;
Improve: mlog2waffle now support event index created by mod_security 
         compiled/patched by Atomic Turtle;
Improve: Better session handling.
         - The session are regenerated when a sucessful login occour, 
         and after 10 times the SESSION_TIMEOUT, make session more 
         robust against session hijack/fixation.
         - Expiration are now better handled, timeout happen between 
         the finish of a page processing and the next access;
Bug: In some circunstances the filter dialog are unable to show web 
     hostnames (ie. when more that 2000 entries are available), this 
     is a limitation/protection of browsers. Now the hostname was 
     changed from a combo-box, to a text input with autocomplete powered 
     by a Ajax interface, that brings hostnames when you type it on 
     hostname field. This fixes issue #15 on github. Thanks to Juraj
     Sakala for report and discuss it; 
Bug: Session is now enforced rightly when an AJAX operation is called.
Bug: Custom Tags ID's changed to in 1000, to avoid conflict with native 
     tags (thanks to juraj sakala);
Bug: Typo corrected in mlog2waffle.conf (thanks to Juraj Sakala)
Bug: Typo corrected in event feeder wizard;
Bug: Text revised in event feeder wizard;
Bug: Better URL handling in request, patch from Juraj Sakala);
Bug: Typo correction in functions.php, patch from Juraj Sakala);
Bug: Issue #37, bad dashboard page formating, patch from Juraj Sakala);
Bug: This change addresses the issue 43 at 
     http://code.google.com/p/waf-fle/issues/. It reflects problem with 
     parsing of the modsec index file line where is empty or malformed 
     Host header. Patch from Juraj Sakala
Bug: fixed issue #43, when processing filter with "not tag" generate an 
     error.
Bug: Issue #45, unescaped output on TopRules chart, make chart unusable 
     with special character in rule description. Thanks to Ibere Tizio, 
     by report and propose a fix.
Bug: Issue #47, type in redirect definition on waf-fle.conf (apache 
     config file) for WAF-FLE.
Bug: Issue #47, error in IP address validation function of Add Sensor in 
     managment interface.     
Bug: Fixes github issue #13, processing of client ip range defined by a 
     netmask.
Bug: Change the management menu behavior, to address a performance 
     impact described by Juraj Sakala (in issue #14 on GitHub). A 
     temporary denial of service happens while database events are 
     counted for get sensor information. Now the user can change (on 
     config.php and in runtime) if Sensor Info will be loaded or not.
     Database schema change to fix this, but will change in update 
     process only on next release, if you want to change now access you 
     MySQL and use the command below (this can need some time and disk 
     space): 
     
     # use waffle;
     # ALTER TABLE `waffle`.`events` ADD INDEX `sensor3` (`sensor_id`);


Version 0.6.3: Jan, 30 2014

     waf-fle's  database schema, producing an error 500;
Bug: Fixed filter dialog showed in login page when accessed with a valid 
     session
Bug: Fixed issue #20, setup now handle database privilege when mysql and 
     waf-fle are in diferent hosts. Now you can specify the client 
     hostname/address or even a wildcard on setup.
Bug: Fixed issue #26, where the timming filters are not filtering 
     properly. 
Bug: Fixed issue #28, delete events by filter hit a error 500, when any 
     filter beyond date range is used.
Improve: Event delete limit ($deleteLimit) and delete wait ($deleteWait)
         is now parameters in config.php, as sugested in issue #31. This 
         parameters also affect Mark as False Positive events of Current 
         Filter.
Improve: when used with SSL mlog2waffle now allow to define if 
         certificate need to be validated or not. Needed when a self-
