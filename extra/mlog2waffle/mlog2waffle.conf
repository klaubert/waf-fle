# Configuration file for mlog2waffle
# modsecurity need to be configured to log in concurrent mode, example, 
# in Modsecurity config use some thing like this:
#
#   SecAuditLogParts ABIJDEFGHZ
#   SecAuditLogType Concurrent
#   SecAuditLog "/var/log/mlog2waffe/mlog2waffe-index"
#   SecAuditLogStorageDir /var/log/mlog2waffe/data
#
# In this way you can set mlog2waffle to tail mode (see below) and 
# check file continuously, sending events in real time to WAF-FLE, or
# run a schedulled "batch" mode.
# 
# Requirements: File::Tail perl module, use your own or the provided 
# with WAF-FLE package (you may need to ajust the path in mlog2waffe-waffle).


# Define the complete URI of WAF-FLE controller, http or https
$CONSOLE_URI = "http://localhost/controller/";

# Define username used to put events on WAF-FLE for this sensor
$CONSOLE_USERNAME = "teste";

# Define password used to put events on WAF-FLE for this sensor
$CONSOLE_PASSWORD = "teste";

# $MODSEC_DIRECTORY is where the concurrent audit logs are stored. 
# In modsecurity configuration is defined by SecAuditLogStorageDir directive
$MODSEC_DIRECTORY = "/var/log/mlog2waffe/data/";

# $INDEX_FILE is defined by SecAuditLog modsecurity directive, it is a index
# file of events generated by concurrent log type
$INDEX_FILE = "/var/log/mlog2waffe/mlog2waffe-index";

# $ERROR_LOG is a mlog2waffe-waffle error log, write permission is needed.
$ERROR_LOG = "/var/log/mlog2waffe/mlog2waffe-error.log";

# Define the execution mode:
#  - "tail": for run continuously, waiting for new entries on log file; 
#  - "batch": for run and exit at end, but recording (offset file) the 
#     position in the last run, speeding up next execution. You can schedulle
#     the mlog2waffe in crontab to run periocally (for example, each 5min).
$MODE = "tail";

# Set $FULL_TAIL = "TRUE" to make tail mode read full file at start, set to 
# "FALSE" to start to read at end of file.
$FULL_TAIL = "FALSE";

# $PIDFILE set the file used to store process id when running in tail mode, forked as a daemon
$PIDFILE = "/var/run/mlog2waffle.pid";

# Define offset file, used as a checkpoint for batch mode, it need permission
# to write in this file.
$OFFSET_FILE = "/var/log/mlog2waffe/offset";

# Set the max number of threads used to send parallel events do WAF-FLE, 
# if you need more performance to push events to WAF-FLE, try to increase
# to a higher value. Remember, higher number of threads, higher CPU usage.
$THREADMAX = 2;
 
# Set $CHECK_CONNECTIVITY to "TRUE" to check connectivity with WAF-FLE before
# send any event to it. Set to "FALSE" to avoid the check, or for use with 
# another console.
$CHECK_CONNECTIVITY = "TRUE";

# Set $CHECK_CERT to "TRUE" to check server certificate, valid only with using ssl (https) 
# on WAF-FLE server. Set to "FALSE" to avoid check certificate validity (commonly used with
# self-signed certificate
$CHECK_CERT = "TRUE";

# If $DEBUG is set to "TRUE" it will write in $DEBUG_FILE the request and response
# between mlog2waffe-waffle and WAF-FLE
$DEBUG = "FALSE";

# $DEBUG_FILE
$DEBUG_FILE = "/var/log/mlog2waffe/mlog2waffle.debug";
