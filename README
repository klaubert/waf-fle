SUMMARY:
---------
WAF-FLE is a Console for the ModSecurity, it allow the ModSecurity admin to
view, filter and analyze events created by ModSecurity (sent using mlogc or
mlog2waffle), using the graphical dashboard to drill-down event and look
quickly the most relevant events.
   
Version 0.6.0
---------------
Requirements:
   Apache 2.x server
      modrewrite
   PHP 5.3 or higher
   PHP PDO Mysql extension
   PHP GeoIP extension
   MySQL 5.1 or later
    
Supported:
   APC (php cache);
   Consider to install and enable APC to improve WAF-FLE performance.

     
CHANGES:
--------
Check ChangeLog file.
  
  
GeoIP Preparation:
------------------
In order to make things work properly, you need to make some 'hack' in GeoIP
configuration, once the PHP don't have a function to check Automomous System
Number (ASN).
  
Install the PHP-GeoIP extension
   - On Ubuntu you can use: 
     apt-get install php5-geoip
   - On RHEL/CentOS 5, you can to use EPEL and IUS Community Project
     yum install php53u-pecl-geoip
   - On RHEL/CentOS 6, you can use EPEL
  
   After this instalation, you need to download MaxMind GeoIP Database, follow:
   mkdir /usr/share/GeoIP/
   cd /usr/share/GeoIP/
   http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz
   http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
   http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/asnum/GeoIPASNum.dat.gz
  
   gzip -d GeoIP.dat.gz
   gzip -d GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
   gzip -d GeoIPASNum.dat.gz
   mv GeoLiteCity.dat GeoIPCity.dat
   # To make php GeoIP extension work with ASNum database
   cp GeoIPASNum.dat GeoIPISP.dat  
      
INSTALLATION:
--------------  
This version of WAF-FLE was tested with (but should work in others OS's once
the requirements are met):
  - CentOS 5, 6: ModSecurity 2.5/2.6
  - Ubuntu 10, 11, 12: ModSecurity 2.6/2.7
  
Extract the WAF-FLE in a directory like "/usr/local/waf-fle", outside Apache
web root. Copy the "extra/waf-fle.conf" to Apache configuration directory
(normaly /etc/httpd/conf.d), edit the file to reflect the WAF-FLE location.
Reload Apache configuration.
  
Database setup:
Starting with this version, you have two ways to create the database, manually
(like in the last version), or using the WAF-FLE Web Setup (recomended):
  
1) Creating Database Manually:
   
   Create a database on MySQL, give permission to a user, and edit config.php
   to inform the Host, Database, User and Password used to access MySQL.
   
   Import "waffle.mysql" scheme to created the database on MySQL:

   Move to WAF-FLE directory (ex. /usr/local/waf-fle/)
   # cd /usr/local/waf-fle/

   To create the database structure and populate some tables (to be more
   simple and avoid problems with the 'dash' sign and mysql, we decide to
   strip it from database name).
   
   # mysql -p waffle < extra/waffle.mysql

   Create waffle_user user on database and grant privileges (don't forget to
   change the password below). If your mysql server is on a different machine,
   change the permission line on GRANT command, and in config.php
   
   # mysql -p

   mysql> CREATE USER 'waffle_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';
   mysql> GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES
          ON `waffle` . * TO 'waffle_user'@'localhost';

   Edit 'config.php' file to reflect the database, username and password.
   
   Access http(s)://<WAF-FLE_HOST>/waf-fle/ (you will asked to change the
   default password on first access)
      Username: admin
      Password: admin
    
   
2) Using WAF-FLE Web Setup to create Database and check dependencies:
   Edit the config.php to define all needed parameters, like database server,
   username and password, and turn $SETUP variable "true", after that you need
   to point your browser to http(s)://<WAF-FLE_HOST>/waf-fle/setup.php, follow
   the steps in the page.


ATTENTION CRS USERS:
--------------------

If you run WAF-FLE in a machine with ModSecurity (you could use a different
server to WAF-FLE if you wish), using Core Rule Set (CRS), you can experience
problems with some rules that run in phase 1. One case is with the rule
"allowed method" (id 960032), other rules that match in phase 1 probably will
cause problems too.
The exception made in waf-fle.conf don't work with this rules. Because this,
you are adviced to use a bypass rule, put in proper order in your CRS
structure.

For example, you can create a "modsecurity_crs_11_waffle.conf" file with rule
below:
  SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME '^/controller/$' \
    "phase:1,msg:'Match',id:99999,nolog,noauditlog,allow,ctl:RuleEngine=On"

  This rule turn modsecurity engine only to controller path (to avoid unwanted
  log in DetectionOnly mode)

   
UPGRADE:
--------
   0.6.0-rcX - 0.6.0 
      Just copy new files over old files. No change on database scheme.
   0.5x -> 0.6.0-rc1
      Many changes on database schema. To upgrade the schema and migrate the
      data you must edit the config.php and define all needed parameters, like
      database server, username and password, and turn $SETUP variable "true"
      in config.php. After that you need to point your browser to
      http(s)://webserver/waf-fle/setup.php, follow the steps in that page.
      If you already have lots of events in database, the migration can take a
      long time.
      At this time, the upgrade script will neither compress data, nor process
      GeoIP data from source ip.
    
   0.5 -> 0.5.1
      Just copy new files over old files. No change on database scheme.
  
    
RECEIVING EVENTS:
-----------------
Once the setup is finished, you can configure a sensor and start to send
events from his.
To achieve this you need to use the Management menu -> create a New Sensor,
use this information to set mlogc/mlog2waffle configuration properly. 
In management interface you have the "Event Feeder Wizard" that you can use to
create mlogc and mlog2waffle configurations.
As soon as the events get generated by ModSecurity its will be showed on
WAF-FLE. 

Sensor Configuration, Option 1, mlogc:
-------------------------------
   On the sensor you'll need to use the mlogc provided with ModSecurity. You
   can follow the standard configuration of mlogc, but directing the logs to
   WAF-FLEas bellow:

      ConsoleURI          "http://waf-fle_address:80/controller/"
      SensorUsername      "SENSOR_USERNAME"
      SensorPassword      "SENSOR_PASSWORD"

   Sensor Configuration, Option 2, mlog2waffle:
   -------------------------------
   You can use the mlog2waffle provided with WAF-FLE. Check more details in
   extra/mlog2waffle/README for details. 
   mlog2waffle is writed in perl and can run as a service or in crontab, not
   piped with Apache.
   In this version mlog2waffle must be considered in beta stage, use with
   caution.

EXTRA CONFIG:
-------------
If you run WAF-FLE in a exclusive server or dedicated virtual host you can
consider to make a redirection of root location "/" to /waf-fle/, using the
lines commented on WAF-FLE Apache config waf-fle.conf (you'll need mod_alias
loaded):
   
   RedirectMatch ^/$ /waf-fle/
     
   Reload Apache config
